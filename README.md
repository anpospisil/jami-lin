Please, keep in mind that this is a work in progress. More functionality to come!

## Concept

This re-design started as a course project at McMaster University to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with UX methods such as value proposition, sketches, wireframes and client feedback to create an informed an current design. Since learning new technologies at Codaisseur Academy, I continue to develop the re-design's functionality.

## Original Site

This is the original [site](jamilin.com).

## Technical Needs Assessment

At first glace there are a few challenges that really require attention.

1. The site has very poor readability to the point where it becomes an accessibility issue.
2. There is no clear visual hierarchy
3. Not mobile friendly 

## Re-design

Here's a look at my [re-design](https://jami-lin-redesign.netlify.app/).

Got it? | Challenge |
:------------ | :-------------| 
:heavy_check_mark:| Readable |
:heavy_check_mark:| Clear visual hierarchy with unity of design|
:heavy_check_mark:| Mobile-Friendly!|

## UX/UI stuff

There are a lot of assessments and research I did for this project which I will post [here](#). With a clear idea of the needs of this project, I developed sketches, wireframes, high filelity prototypes and the live site.

## Sketches

## Wireframes & Prototyping

You can check out a functional prototype of the below wireframe [here](https://invis.io/WMOOV3FP7SX#/326741235_JLP-Home---Wireframe-Cc-Premium_-1--pdf_1).

## First Draft

I just want to pause here for a sec to reflect on my first attempt at building a site with HTML & CSS. It's humbling to understand where I started, encouraging to know how far I've come and exciting to think of how much more I have to learn!

## Next steps

I have an active [Kanban](https://github.com/anpospisil/jami-lin-frontend/projects/1) board for this project, but I would like to quickly outline a couple feature I am excited to develop:

1. Click Tracking: I love the idea of a user being able to see their last viewed article. I hope to develop this further to change the product and article recommendations on the home page.
2. Template Email: It's clear that branding and unity of design does not end with just a website. As such, I want to improve my Email templating skills! 
3. Favorites: I want users favorite articles to be stored so they are able to view them once signed in. I'm excited to explore Redux some more to achieve this.

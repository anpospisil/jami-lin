## Concept

This re-design started as a course project at McMaster University to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with UX methods such as value proposition, sketches, wireframes and client feedback to create an informed an current design. Since learning new technologies at Codaisseur Academy, I continue to develop the re-design's functionality.

## Original Site

This is the original [site](jamilin.com).

## Technical Needs Assessment

At first glace there are a few challenges that really require attention.

1. The site has very poor readability to the point where it becomes an accessibility issue.
2. There is no clear visual hierarchy
3. Not mobile friendly 

## Re-design

Here's a look at my [re-design](https://jami-lin-redesign.netlify.app/).

Got it? | Challenge |
:------------ | :-------------| 
:heavy_check_mark:| Readable |
:heavy_check_mark:| Clear visual hierarchy with unity of design|
:heavy_check_mark:| Mobile-Friendly!|

## UX/UI stuff

There are a lot of assessments and research I did for this project which I will post [here]. With a clear idea of the needs of this project, I developed sketches, wireframes, high filelity prototypes and the live site.
